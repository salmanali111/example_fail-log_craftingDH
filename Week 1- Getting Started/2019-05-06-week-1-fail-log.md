Week 1 Fail Log Crafting DH 
First Annotation 
  -My first annotation emerged when reading the instructions in the Crafting DH workbook where it specifically instructed readers to download the Hypothes.is plug-in and to annotatae the words "This text". This was the first time I have ever annotated anything, and it was interesting to udnerstand and decipher an application plug-in which helps in such an extraordinary way. 
  Second Annotation 
    -My second annotation was a direct question regarding the course and its layout with specificity to whether or not there are videod lectures for this course. It is somewhat difficult to learn a new program with so many different plug-ins involved especically solely through text-instructions and was wondering whether this would be how the remainder of the course will take play. If there are lectures available, where can I access them in order to relieve some stress regarding this course.
